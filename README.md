# LenRoot Minecraft plugin

This is the repository of the main plugin of Len ecosystem. You will need this to run all of the others.

It is contains a module manager, each module is called LenFeature. There are some built in and some external.

This plugin main focus is on providing database, config manager and module system for other plugins that I make.
